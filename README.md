# Rubik-stats

I created this project to analyse the statistics multiphases of rubik's cube, generated by the cube timer cstimer.

It is specifically designed for multiphases stats. This requires you to download the statistics from cstimer.

To use it, git clone or download the repository, navigate to his directory, and install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can import the module, and import the statistics file generated by cstimer:

```python
import main
stats = main.read_cstimer(<file_stats>)
```

I used a subclass of dataframe of pandas to store all the statistics of each phase. You can display them with `print`:

```python
print(stats)
```

Here's some features you can do with it (some are not yet implemented)

```python

ao5 = stats.ao(5) # To get the ao5 of each phase
ao5.pie_chart() # display a pie chart of each phase
p1 = stats.analyse_metric("P1") # get the ao5,ao12,... of the first phase
p1.trends() # get the graph trend of it, with the ao5, ao12.

```
